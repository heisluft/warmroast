# WarmRoast
**Note**: This fork is a more bare version of the original and may or may not be useful for anyone
except me.


WarmRoast is an easy-to-use CPU sampling tool for JVM applications, but particularly suited for Minecraft servers/clients.

* Adjustable sampling frequency.
* Web-based â€” perform the profiling on a remote server and view the results in your browser.
 * Collapse and expand nodes to see details.
 * Easily view CPU usage per method at a glance.
 * Hover to highlight all child methods as a group.
 * See the percentage of CPU time for each method relative to its parent methods.
 * Maintains style and function with use of "File -> Save As" (in tested browsers).

Java 8 and above is required to use WarmRoast.

## Changes of this fork
- Switched to Gradle
- Requires Java 8 to run
- It is no longer required to know your jdk location, WarmRoast should work out of the box now
- Mappings are not supported for now, MCP mappings are not applicable for my work and add unneeded clutter

## Usage

1. Download WarmRoast.
2. In your shell, run the following command:
```java -jar warmroast-1.1.0--thread "Server thread"```

**Note:** The example command line below includes `--thread "Server thread"`, which filters all threads but the main server thread. You can remove it to show all threads.
